              Can I Request a Replacement Rather Than a Refund?

              If you prefer to replace your product, just let our Customer Service executive know your choice and we will call you as soon as your initial product has been received and we have checked the availability of the replacement product.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              As a refund, you can either claim a store credit Refund Voucher for the amount you paid for your returned item, or request a complete cash refund. For a store credit voucher, you can use it for a new purchase on the website by deducting the voucher amount from the new total. For a cash refund, the amount will be reimbursed via an online bank transfer or by a cheque mailed to your address. In case of credit card payments, the refund can be processed as a store credit Refund Voucher or via transaction reversal.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is a Refund Voucher?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              A Refund Voucher is a return mechanism equal in value to the amount paid for the returned item. You can use the Refund Voucher at checkout to discount the voucher amount from your next purchase. This voucher can be used on multiple purchases (if the purchase value is less than the voucher amount) until your refund voucher balance reaches PKR 0. A Refund Voucher is valid for 180 days, after which it will expire and cannot be used.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How Do I Use My Refund Voucher?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              If you have been issued a Refund Voucher, you will receive a discount voucher code via email. Please enter this code in the discount code box and click "Apply Code" during checkout at the payment step. A corresponding deduction will then be applied to your total amount.

              I Have Bought an Item on Promotion or with a Discount Code. What Amount Will You Refund Me?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              For items purchased on sale, if a refund is allowed, the amount refunded will be the exact amount you paid, not the item's original value. For example, if you purchased an item on sale for PKR 500 (with an original value of PKR 1000), we will refund you PKR 500 only. If you purchased an item using a Refund Voucher, we will refund you the sum of the amount paid (including the amount of the Refund Voucher used).
